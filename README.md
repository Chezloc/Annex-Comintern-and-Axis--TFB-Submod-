A TFB submod which gives a decision for Germany and USSR to annex their faction members.

- Germany and USSR will core the land the annexed countries have cored (for example Italian African colonies wouldnt get cored, however the only exception is Tannu Tuva getting cored by the USSR because they historically were in the USSR)

- Germany and USSR will get the compliance the states had when annexing them, for example in sinkiang mongolia had 70% compliance so ussr also gets 70% compliance there

- Germany and USSR will get all the equipment, units, planes, ships of the annexed nations

- Germany will get 1 research slot to compensate for the fact they need to also do navy

- Germany unlocks decisions to merge African colonies, make German east africa and to add somalia to the colony when its taken in WW2

- Germany unlocks decisions to drill for oil in Libya

- T-34 reseach is now 1939 tech not 1940 to balance game more

- Add extra soviet focuses to balance the game if axis annexed

- Add weapon development and anti air deployment decisions for soviets to balance the game if axis annexed
